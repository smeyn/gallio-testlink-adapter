The TestLink API is a .NET library providing access to the XML-RPC API of Testlink.

TestLink enables easily to create and manage Test cases as well as organize 
them into Test plans. These Test plans allow team members to execute Test 
cases and track test results dynamically, generate reports, trace software 
requirements, prioritize and assign tasks.
