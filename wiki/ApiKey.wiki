#summary What is the APIKey.

= Introduction =

The ApiKey is necessary for all calls to Testlink. It is generated by TestLink.
The ApiKey is referred to as DevKey in the TestLinkFixture.

= Details =

To get your ApiKey Testlink must have the API enabled in the file custom_config.inc.php:
{{{
$tlCfg->api->enabled = TRUE;
}}}

(N.B. the documentation has a defect, the above syntax is correct)

Then, after logging in click on the Link marked *Personal* in the top menu bar. This brings up a list of things, including a section marked *API interface*.
That section contains the API Access Key.
