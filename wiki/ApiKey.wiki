#summary What is the APIKey.

= Introduction =

The ApiKey (or DevKey) is generated by TestLink.

= Details =

To get your ApiKey Testlink must have the API enabled:
{{{
$tlCfg->api->enabled = FALSE;
}}}

(N.B. the documentation has a defect, the above syntax is correct)

Then, after logging in click on the Link marked *Personal* in the top menu bar. This brings up a list of things, including a section marked *API interface*.
That section contains the API Access Key.
