NUnit TestLink Adapter
Copyright (c) 20012, Stephan Meyn <stephanmeyn@gmail.com>
V1.2 Release 26 June 2012
The adaptor has been changed slightly and works with NUnit V2.6

Known Defect, the adaptor wil not show up in the extension listing.
According to the NUnit logs this is due to the testlink extension 'is built by a runtime newer than the currently loaded runtime'.
Howecer it still works!

The biggest change is the introduction of the config file. The Testlink Fixture can now specify a configuration file.
thie configuration file (a simple XML file) can override or provide default values for the Testlink Fixture Attribute.
This means values such as path to test link, etc, can be easily changed without having to rebuild the test code.
See tlinkConfig.xml for an example

Finished interim solution. 

Outstanding Issue: the MSI installed version of Nunit won't load the addin. (version nr wrong in fusion log). 
Sent a question to Nunit-discuss in google groups

However works with version that has been compiled directly from sources.

Class Test Case Inspector is now irrelevant. 
TestRunFinished will now see DLL names and then load assemblies to build up dictionary of fixtureAttributes

TestSuite and TestCaseResult are now replaced with TestResult
