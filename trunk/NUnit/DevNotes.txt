Finished interim solution. 

Outstanding Issue: the MSI installed version of Nunit won't load the addin. (version nr wrong in fusion log). 
Sent a question to Nunit-discuss in google groups

However works with version that has been compiled directly from sources.

Class Test Case Inspector is now irrelevant. 
TestRunFinished will now see DLL names and then load assemblies to build up dictionary of fixtureAttributes

TestSuite and TestCaseResult are now replaced with TestResult
