The Gallio Testlink Adapter is an extension for the Gallio Framework. 
It provides the ability to automatically record unit test results to TestLink.

The Gallio Automation Platform is an open, extensible, and neutral 
system for .NET that provides a common object model, runtime services 
and tools (such as test runners) that may be leveraged by any number 
of test frameworks. At present Gallio can run tests from MbUnit versions 2 
and 3, MSTest, NBehave, NUnit, xUnit.Net, and csUnit. 
Gallio provides tool support and integration with CCNet, MSBuild, NAnt, 
NCover, Pex, Powershell, Resharper, TestDriven?.Net, TypeMock?, 
and Visual Studio Team System.

TestLink? enables easily to create and manage Test cases as well as organize 
them into Test plans. These Test plans allow team members to execute Test 
cases and track test results dynamically, generate reports, trace software 
requirements, prioritize and assign tasks.
