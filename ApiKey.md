# Introduction #

The ApiKey is necessary for all calls to Testlink. It is generated by TestLink.
The ApiKey is referred to as DevKey in the TestLinkFixture.

# Details #

To get your ApiKey Testlink must have the API enabled in the file custom\_config.inc.php:
```
$tlCfg->api->enabled = TRUE;
```

(N.B. the documentation has a defect, the above syntax is correct)

Then, after logging in click on the Link marked **Personal** in the top menu bar. This brings up a list of things, including a section marked **API interface**.
That section contains the API Access Key.
